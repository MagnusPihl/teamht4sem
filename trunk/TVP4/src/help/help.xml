Once selected left-click or drag the mouse over the tiles you wish to add nodes to. If you've somehow placed a node you wish to delete right-click it.
                If you wish to add nodes with a special points value, change the number in the points textbox, and draw over the nodes you wish to change value for or the tiles you wish to add new nodes to. <br/>
                Once you've done drawing nodes select the Pacman or ghost brush to add these. You can only add one Pacman and two ghosts. Ghosts and Pacman can be removed by right-clicking them. Once you've done placing entities save the level and your done.

                        The path brush is used to draw the nodes that the entities of the game traverse. When left-clicking on an empty tile a new node will be added with the amount of points specified in the points textbox. When placing a new node, links will be established to any nodes adjacent to it. It is not possible to remove or add connections seperately. When left-clicking on an already existing node the points held by the node will be changed to reflect the number of points specified in the points textbox. When right-clicking on a node it will be removed and all connections and links to it severed.

                The scan is used to initiate the scanning of a physical level using a LEGO robot. 
                The window consists of a log, scan and a cancel button. 
                While scanning the already scanned parts of the level will be shown on the canvas.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Scan button</strong><br />
                        The scan button will start the scanning of a physical level. 
                        Before you press the scan button you should make sure 
                        that you've turned on the LEGO robot marked 1, 
                        downloaded the robot software, placed the LEGO robot on the 
                        physical level, and started the software. 
                    </li>                                
                    <li>
                        <strong>Cancel button</strong><br />
                        The cancel button will stop the scanning process. 
                        Once you've stopped scanning in a level you cannot continue scanning the current level,
                        if you try anyways the scanning process will start over.

                        The log is large text area in the middle of the scan dialog.
